    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of 
        persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is 
        easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon. For 1 cup of 
        persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on 
        their size. You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically 
        take longer to fully ripen than hachiya.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup persimmon pulp</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F 
            (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x4-inch pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, cinnamon, salt, nuts, and raisins in a small 
            bowl.</li>
        <li>Blend eggs, sugar, and oil in a large bowl. Stir baking soda into 
            persimmon pulp until well blended; add to sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Fold in flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the 
            center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 
            minutes.</li>
    </ol>
