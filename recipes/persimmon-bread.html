    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of 
        persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is 
        easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon. For 1 cup of 
        persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on 
        their size. You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically 
        take longer to fully ripen than hachiya.
