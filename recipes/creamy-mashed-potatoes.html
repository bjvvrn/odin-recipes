    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        These make-ahead mashed potatoes are rich, creamy, and smooth. You can 
        do nearly everything up to two days ahead — a great option to give you 
        a few extra hours on those big holidays. Adding butter after you reheat 
        them makes them taste freshly mashed.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds russet potatoes, scrubbed but unpeeled</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to 
            a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 
            minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat half-and-half in the microwave until just warm.</li>
        <li>Process unpeeled potatoes through a food mill into a medium bowl. 
            (Or, using a potholder, peel and drop them into a bowl. Puree using 
            a potato masher or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.) 
            Stir in warm half-and-half and salt (or beat, if using a mixer) 
            until smooth and fluffy. Cool, cover, and refrigerate potatoes in a 
            microwave-safe, airtight container for up to 2 days.</li>
        <li>Thirty minutes before serving, microwave until warm. Transfer to a 
            heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir in butter to 
            melt. Cover and keep warm.</li>
    </ol>
