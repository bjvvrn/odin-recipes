    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        These make-ahead mashed potatoes are rich, creamy, and smooth. You can 
        do nearly everything up to two days ahead — a great option to give you 
        a few extra hours on those big holidays. Adding butter after you reheat 
        them makes them taste freshly mashed.
