# Odin Recipes

This project consists of a simple website with a main index page that contains 
links to three recipes sourced from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/). 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of basic HTML elements 
such as `img`, `a`, `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `ol`, `ul`, and `li`. It also shows how to 
set up a proper HTML boilerplate and organize a website’s file structure to 
ensure clean links and smooth navigation during development.
